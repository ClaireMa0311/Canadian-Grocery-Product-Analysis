based on this write r code to create a story comparing relationship between product count ad average size between vendors 

ChatGPT
The newly uploaded dataset contains the following columns:

vendor: The name of the vendor.
avg_package_size_kg: The average package size (in kilograms) for each vendor.
unique_product_count: The number of unique products each vendor offers.
With this data, we can compare the relationship between the unique product count and average package size across different vendors. Below is an R code snippet to create a story visualization comparing these relationships.

R Code for Story Visualization
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset (assuming it’s stored as 'cleaned_data.csv' in your working directory)
data <- read.csv("cleaned_data.csv")

# Initial data exploration and summary
summary(data)

# Plotting: Relationship between Unique Product Count and Average Package Size
ggplot(data, aes(x = unique_product_count, y = avg_package_size_kg, label = vendor)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_text(vjust = -1.5, hjust = 0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Unique Product Count and Average Package Size by Vendor",
       x = "Unique Product Count",
       y = "Average Package Size (kg)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", linetype = "dashed", se = FALSE) +
  annotate("text", x = max(data$unique_product_count), y = max(data$avg_package_size_kg),
           label = "Red line shows trend between product count and package size", hjust = 1)

# Summary of findings
# Use 'summary(lm(avg_package_size_kg ~ unique_product_count, data = data))' to analyze the trend.
model <- lm(avg_package_size_kg ~ unique_product_count, data = data)
summary(model)
Explanation of the R Code
Load and Inspect Data: This code loads the cleaned_data.csv dataset and checks the summary to understand the ranges of each variable.
Create Scatter Plot: It plots unique_product_count (x-axis) against avg_package_size_kg (y-axis), with each vendor labeled. This visualizes how vendors compare in terms of product diversity and average package size.
Add Trendline: A linear trendline (red, dashed) is added to indicate the relationship between product count and package size.
Model Summary: The linear model lm(avg_package_size_kg ~ unique_product_count) provides a summary to interpret the relationship between product count and package size.
This analysis will help reveal any trends, such as whether vendors with higher product counts tend to have smaller or larger average package sizes, providing insights into vendor strategies in product variety and packaging. ​​
