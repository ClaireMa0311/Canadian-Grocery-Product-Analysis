# Exploring the Relationship Between Product Variety and Package Size Across Vendors: A Correlational Analysis Revealing a Positive Association
## Overview
This study investigates the relationship between unique product count and average package size across various retail vendors. Using a correlational analysis, we aimed to determine whether vendors with a broader product selection tend to offer larger average package sizes. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between product count and package size, indicating that vendors with higher product diversity, such as Walmart, generally provide larger packages, potentially reflecting a focus on bulk items or a diverse inventory strategy. However, this correlation does not imply causation, as additional factors, including product types and target demographics, may influence this relationship. The analysis also discusses limitations such as missing data and potential sources of bias. This preliminary investigation provides insights into retail packaging and inventory strategies, highlighting the need for further research to better understand the drivers behind these trends. Some of the R code used to create this work was adapted from Alexander (2023).
